# Movie Library Python Mini-Project

Welcome to the code documentation for this mini-project. This is forked from Udacity's ud036_StarterCode project(https://github.com/udacity/ud036_StarterCode). This is a python project so there are a few pre-requisites in order to run this project.

## Prerequistes

* Install python in your current Operating System. I am using 2.7.11 https://www.python.org/ .

## Project structure

* fresh_tomatoes.py (Is the python code from the main project that generates the webpage to display   our movies) <br/>

* video.py (is the main python class to be used to play videos.)<br/>
    | - media.py (is the python file that contains the class called Movies that holds information       about movies) extends Video class<br/>
    | - series.py (was supposed to be the python file that contains the class Series that would         hold information about Tv-series) extends Video class<br/>

* entertainment_center.py (The python file that contains the main execution code using the          fresh_tomatoes.py and media.py files)<br/>
